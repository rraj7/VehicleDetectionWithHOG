# VehicleDetectionWithHOG

The dataset used for training of the features is the KITTI and GTI dataset, the .zip file for the
same is present in the folder.
• Please unzip (extract) the zip files before running the code.
• For the feature extraction, we have used color histogram, Spatial Binning and Histogram of
Oriented Gradients (HOG).
• Comparison is made for different classifiers once the feature extraction is complete. The
classifiers used to compare are Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine Classifier and Random
Forrest Classifier.
• The SVM Classifier gives a better accuracy score with less amount of execution time.
